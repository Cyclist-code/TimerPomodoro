Timer Pomodoro is a time management app that can be used for any task.
## Pomodoro method
Pomodoro is a method of scheduling time to increase productivity. The main idea is to work in short steps: 25 minutes of work, then a five minute break. 
During breaks - a complete change of activity. This algorithm must be repeated four times, that is, "eat four tomatoes." And then - a long break to rest.</br>
